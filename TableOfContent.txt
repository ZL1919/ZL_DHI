Largely based on Mike Ross's code
Contains minimum code to process DHI photos.
You can add more Mike's or Ellie's codes if you find them helpful at some point.

DHI_recon_invert_all.m the main code to run DHI.

shotnumber_inputs.m enter your shot number pairs, reconstruction image, twin pair, and 1st order diffraction image coordinate here.

comb_den_int_fig.m combines two line-integrated density figure together. It uses the fictional month convention. Feel free to update the code that serves you the best.
comb_den_num_fig.m works in a similar way.

DISS_DHI_basicRecon.m is not updated to the camera spec, but is contained in the repository for reference.
DISS_shotnumber_inputs.m, shot_base_pair.m, and MDS_DHI_put.m have MDSplus integration and are currently not used. They are contained in the repository for reference.
