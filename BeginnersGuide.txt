Zhangsheng Lian's 2-chord DHI code, beginner's guide.
Largely based on Mike Ross's code.

Define appropriate file name and directory in DHI_recon_invert_all.m and holographic_reconstruction.m. Be a bit patient.

Start with DHI_recon_invert_all.m and shotnumber_inputs.m
Before mass processing.
·In shotnumber_inputs.m 
Define 2 shot numbers (1 baseline, 1 plasma), reconstruction distance, and boundary of 1st-order image.
If you are not familiar with the code and what a photo demo, start with what's in shotnumber_inputs_demo.m and corresponding photo files.
If you are not familiar with the code and what to use your own photo, try start with d=1.5; xmin=0.0020; xmax=0.0110; ymin=0.0020; ymax=0.0110; sign_twin=1;. These numbers are probably wrong, but probably keeps the code running.
·In DHI_recon_invert_all.m 
You can place a breakpoint at line 107 for now.
Set your z_loc.
Run DHI_recon_invert_all.m; you should get the reconstructed phase map.
Observe 1st-order image and 0th-order image. Adjust reconstruction distance, and run the code again. Repeat such process until the these images are clearly separate but not too far away from each other.
Update xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, so that these number box out a 1st-order image.
Clear the break point. 

Run DHI_recon_invert_all.m and observe line-integrated density plot.
If the gradient of line-integrated density makes sense, then sign_twin is correct.
If the gradient makes no sense, then flip sign_twin, and run the code again.
If the gradient makes no sense regardless of sign_twin, then your photo probably didn't capture the pinch, try a different photo.

Once the gradient makes sense, observe the (ordinary) number density plot and see if it makes sense.

If everything looks fine, then you are ready to do mass processing.
